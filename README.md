## User Story

Hello. My name is Paul Hagan.
I created a quiz game about computers using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Project Summation
In this project I created a 
multiple choice quiz game that has a countdown clock. When the quiz taker anwers they are presented with another question and if they answer correctly the timer counts down, but if they answer incorrectly they are penalized by a time deduction. Once the time is up or they have answered all the questions and the game is over. Thier results are logged with thier initials, in local storage, to a high score button. This program will also be responsive to various devices.
